There is a U, V and W (aka Y) wire plane which contains \nwire\n segments.  Each of these planes are slightly offset in the drift direction X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncharge\n\n: refers to an amount of charged particles drifting past the wire plane during one tick.  Sometimes used to refer to the deconvolved ADC in one tick which provides a measure of the charge.  Sometimes used to refer to the un-deconvolved signal.  Yes, it's confusing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwire\n\n: a segment or run of the conductor which senses the passing of drifting charge.  A wire runs in either the U, V or W (aka Y) direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchannel\n\n: the unit of electronics responsible for digitizing charge on a wire.  For detectors with wrapped readout conductors a single channel maps to multiple wires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncell\n\n: a region of the plane surrounding an area near where three wires, one from each plane, are crossing (at least pairwise, if not in a triple-point).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntiling\n\n: the set of cells which fully cover the plane with no gaps nor overlaps.  There is more than one way to tile the plane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblob\n\n: an association of continguous cells which is expected to contain a portion of the charge of the event from one tbin.  In general, the association will include cells which may not actually contain charge.  A blob is bounded by cells (or plane boundaries) which definitely do not contain charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblob cluster\n\n: an association of a number of blobs, potentially from different tbins, which intend to capture an extended portion of charge that came from the passage of a single particle (track) or multiple, closely related particles (shower).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nslice\n\n: a qualifier to indicate information from one tbin.  A wire slice would indicate the collection of charge collected on wires at a given time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nframe\n\n: the collection of slices readout as a continuous unit from the DAQ.",

It's much better to create many small packages and maybe later merge them than it is to split apart ones which have grown too monolithic. When thinking about writing some code consider\n\n\n\n\nWhat other packages will I need?\n\n\nWhat future packages will need mine?\n\n\n\n\nYou may have an idea for a package but in reality it is better split up into others. Here are reasons to believe your ideas fit into multiple packages:\n\n\n\n\nWhen I describe my expected package functionality I use the word \"and\".\n\n\nSome other package should use part of my package but the other part is not needed.\n\n\n\n\nIf in doubt, make more, smaller packages.\n\n\nSource Package Conventions\n\n\nTo make them easy to build and aggregate they must follow a layout convention.\n\n\nFirst, each source package should be kept in it's own git repository. The recommended package naming convention is:\n\n\nwire-cell-NAME\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nNAME\n is some short identifier of the package's primary purpose.\n\n\nThe contents of the source package must be organized following these sub-directory conventions\n\n\nsrc/             # C++ source file for libraries with .cxx extensions or private headers\ninc/NAME/        # public/API C++ header files with .h extensions\ndict/LinkDef.h   # ROOT linkdef header (for rootcling dictionaries)\ntests/           # Unit tests Python (nosetests) files like test_*.py or main C++ programs named like test_*.cxx.\napps/            # main application(s), one appname.cxx file for each app named appname (todo: not yet supported)\npython/NAME      # python modules (todo: not yet supported)\nwscript_build    # a brief waf file\n\n\n\n\nThe \nwscript_build\n file specifies a name for the binary package (in general similar but not identical to the source package name) and a list of any other packages part of the wire-cell system on which it depends. For example the \nwire-cell-nav\n source package builds to a \nWireCellNav\n binary package and it depends on the WireCellData package and so its \nwscript_build\n file is:\n\n\nbld.make_package('WireCellNav', use='WireCellData')\n\n\n\n\nThis is Python and the \nbld\n object is a Waf build context. It is provided automagically when waf interprets this file.\n\n\nBuild packages\n\n\nThe above is about code packages. Code packages are built via a build package. This build package, \nwire-cell\n is but one possible \"view\" into all the wire cell packages. Other build packages may be created which only build some sub-set of all wire cell packages.\n\n\nTo add a new code package to a build package (such as this one) one must do a little, annoying dance:\n\n\n$ mkdir \nname\n\n$ cd \nname\n/\n$ echo \nbld.make_package('WireCell\nName\n', use='WireCellNav WireCellData')\n \n wscript_build\n$ git init\n$ git commit -a -m \nStart code package \nname\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nname\n with your package name. And, of course, you may want to put more code than just the \nwscript_build\n file. Also, that file should list what packages your package depends on.\n\n\nNow, make a new repository by going to the \nBNLIF GitHub\n and clicking \"New repository\" button. Give it a name like \nwire-cell-\nname\n. Copy-and-paste the two command it tells you to use:\n\n\n$ git remote add origin git@github.com:BNLIF/wire-cell-\nname\n.git\n$ git push -u origin master\n\n\n\n\nFinally, move aside the local repository and add it right back as a submodule:\n\n\n$ cd ..  # back to top\n$ mv \nname\n \nname\n.moved\n$ git submodule add -- git@github.com:BNLIF/wire-cell-\nname\n.git \nname\n\n$ git submodule update\n$ git commit -a -m \nAdded \nname\n to top-level build package.\n\n$ git push\n\n\n\n\nWhew!\n\n\nNamespaces\n\n\nThe namespace WireCell is used for all \"core\" wire cell code. Code that is used to glue this core functionality into other systems may use another namespace but should not use WireCell. For example, the \"simple simulation tree\" uses \nWireCellSst\n.\n\n\nIt can be tedious to type explicit namespace qualifiers all the time. You can use the using namespace WireCell; directive where in implementation files (*.cxx) but you should never use it in (top-scope) of header files as it will then leak the contents of the namespace into any unsuspecting file that #include\u2019s it.\n\n\nDealing with git submodules\n\n\nFrom \nthe git book\n, do you updates like:\n\n\n$ git submodule update --remote --rebase\n\n\n\nor like\n\n\n$ git submodule update --remote --merge\n\n\n\nWith:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--rebase\n:\n put our local commits on top of any new ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--merge\n:\n merge our commits into new ones\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first leaves a more \"linear\" commit history while the second leaves\n\"diamonds\" in the history whenever we have briefly diverged from the\nremote repository.  You can run \"\ngitk --all\n\" in wire-cell or one of the\nsubmodules to see what I mean.  Either way is fine.  Rebasing looks\ncleaner in the history but merge captures the subtle fact of where our\nline of development actually diverged.\n\n\nIn that link there are other interesting things to do:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure your repository so \"\ngit status\n\" in the top-level \"wire-cell\" gives us more info on the status of all submodules:\n\n\n$ git config status.submodulesummary 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake it so \"\ngit diff\n\" in wire-cell will also show any diff's in the submodules:\n\n\n$ git config diff.submodule log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check that we will push in the right order (submodules first):\n\n\n$ git push --recurse-submodules=check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo force submodules to push first\n\n\n$ git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run any command in all submodules\n\n\n$ git submodule foreach 'the command'",

The  tbin  counts the time bin from the\n  beginning of the frame, the  qtot  is some measure of the charge for\n  the blob as a whole (and may not necessarily be the sum of the\n  charge on the individual cells).  The  quality is a\n   technique -specific measure of quality and finally the array of\n  cell charge.    BlobCluster  is a (non-owning) association of blobs.  This may be\n  used to collect blobs together within one time slice or may be used\n  to collect them together across multiple time slices such as to form\n  the blobs contributing to a track or a shower.  Blobs are referenced\n  by their index into the frame's  BlobStore .  All available\n   BlobClusters  are stored in the  ClusterStore",
