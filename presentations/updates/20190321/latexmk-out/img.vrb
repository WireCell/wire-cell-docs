\frametitle{Clustering visitor}
  Clustering is a generic function which takes two lists of blobs and a \textbf{functor}:
\begin{verbatim}
    auto assoc = some_function_object;
    RayGrid::associate(blobs_1, blobs_2, assoc);
\end{verbatim}

  The \texttt{associate()} function will call the \texttt{assoc} functor for every pair of blobs which are associated.

  It's then up to the user to do something fun in their functor.
